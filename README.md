# Project Homomorphic Encryption in Cloud Environment

Welcome to the **Applied Cryptography - Group 08** Cloud Processing Module. This component is part of the larger project *Encrypted Intelligence: Leveraging Homomorphic Encryption for Secure Healthcare Analytics*. It demonstrates how to securely process healthcare data in a cloud environment using homomorphic encryptionâ€”enabling computations on encrypted data without exposing sensitive information.

## **Overview**

This module simulates secure cloud processing by performing operations such as data aggregation and computations directly on encrypted inputs. The goal is to enable privacy-preserving data processing in sensitive environments like healthcare, where confidentiality is paramount.

The module consists of:
- **Frontend Application**: Built with React and Vite, providing an intuitive interface for data entry and result visualization.
- **Backend Service**: Developed in C++ using the Crow framework, handling the encryption, secure processing, and decryption operations.

## **Features**

This is still a prototype so functionality is limited to encryption and decryption of data using homomorphic encryption. It also includes an easy to use interface. 

---

## **Prerequisites**
- C++ compiler (version C++ 17)
- CMake (version 3.10 or higher)
- Crow library (this library is already included)

- Node.js ( version 16 or higher)
- npm

## **Installation**

### **1. Clone the Repo**
```bash
git clone https://gitlab.maastrichtuniversity.nl/I6360608/applied-cryptography-group08.git

```

### **2. Run the backend**
```bash
cd applied-cryptography-group08/backend
cd build
./backend
```

### **3. Run the Frontend**
```bash
cd applied-cryptography-group08/frontend/
npm install
npm run dev
```

After running the frontend, open your browser and navigate to the URL provided in the terminal (typically [http://localhost:5173/](http://localhost:5173/)).
